First project
This project takes what i have learnt about html, notably how to write the skeleton, how to reference and navigate from landing to interior pages and how to write text in different sizes and styles using html commands.

UPDATE* 

My second project took what i learnt about CSS and customization of web pages to decorate the interior page "Chips". I used what I learnt about class selectors, class precedence and different properties as well as their values to alter the visual appeal of the page. I used inline and block features to alter the layout of the page, as well as added a border and padding around certain elements to create visible sections.
